## Overview

This repository documents my **DevOps learning journey through hands-on projects**.

Instead of focusing on certifications or isolated tools, it shows how I approach real systems in practice:

- Understanding system architecture  
- Deploying applications manually  
- Automating infrastructure  
- Iterating and improving using DevOps principles  

> Each project is built, broken, rebuilt, and documented with one goal:
> Developing **practical, job-ready DevOps skills**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Many DevOps concepts only really click once you build and operate systems yourself.

This repository exists to:

- Track my **progress from fundamentals to automation**
- Practice **real-world architectures locally**
- Build confidence through **experimentation and repetition**
- Document decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned
- Create a **transparent portfolio** that reflects how I think and work

> All projects are reproducible, explainable, and aligned with real production patterns—even when running locally.

## Learning & Project Structure

Each project follows a **progressive learning model** that mirrors how systems evolve in real environments.

### 1. Manual Deployment
- Understand the technology stack  
- Learn service dependencies  
- Identify failure points  
- Gain operational confidence  

### 2. Automated Deployment
- Convert manual steps into code  
- Make environments repeatable  
- Reduce human error  
- Improve speed and consistency  

### 3. Refactoring & Modernization
- Containerization  
- Orchestration  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Cloud-ready patterns

## Projects in This Repository

### 01 — VProfile: Local Multi-Tier Application (Manual)

Deploy a full multi-tier Java web application stack manually using virtual machines.

**Focus:**
- Architecture understanding  
- Service interaction  
- Manual provisioning and configuration  

---

### 02 — VProfile: Automated Deployment

Automate the same stack using Vagrant and shell scripts.

**Focus:**
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Repeatability  
- Automation workflows  

---

### 03 — Containerization *(Planned)*

Refactor the application stack using Docker.

**Focus:**
- Image design  
- Service isolation  
- Local container orchestration  

---

### 04 — Kubernetes Deployment *(Planned)*

Deploy the application into a Kubernetes cluster.

**Focus:**
- Orchestration concepts  
- Scaling  
- Service discovery  

---

### 05 — CI/CD Pipeline *(Planned)*

Build a pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment.

**Focus:**
- Continuous integration  
- Deployment automation  
- End-to-end workflows  

---

## Tools & Technologies

Throughout this journey, I work with (but am not limited to):

- Linux  
- Git & GitHub  
- Vagrant  
- VirtualBox  
- Bash scripting  
- Nginx  
- Apache Tomcat  
- MySQL  
- Memcached  
- RabbitMQ  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes  
- CI/CD tooling  

> The emphasis is on **understanding why tools are used**, not just how.

## Final Notes

This repository is a living document.  
As my skills grow, so will the projects and documentation.
